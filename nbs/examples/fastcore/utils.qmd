## Functions

    
### `reduce`
    


```{=html}
<blockquote><strong><code>reduce(...)</code></strong></blockquote>
```


    
        reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value
        
        Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,
        from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
        For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
        ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).  If initial is present, it is placed before the items
        of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the
        sequence is empty.
    
### `warn`
    


```{=html}
<blockquote><strong><code>warn(message, category=None, stacklevel=1, source=None)</code></strong></blockquote>
```


    
        Issue a warning, or maybe ignore it or raise an exception.
